# APK_SystemWeb_ProjectGCD
Project created to complement the solution to the problems faced by wholesalers Vania, Fabian and Mauricio, who specialize in the sale of candy (cookies, chocolates, cereals, etc.). They opened their business called "APK" which was put into operation 7 years ago.
This project seeks to improve the efficiency of the sales process, speed up the learning process of workers and reduce the number of errors in sales notes due to the poor implementation of technological tools that will greatly solve these problems.
# DEPENDENCIES
- You need the jdbc.mysqlconnector .jar to establish connection with the local database.
- Download the database: Currently we can only manage the database locally because it is a prototype. Preferably use Xampp for local deployment.
